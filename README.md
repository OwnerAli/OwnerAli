**About Me**

üë®‚Äçüíª I'm a Software Engineer based in the United States, with a strong passion for building efficient systems and crafting engaging user experiences. My expertise lies in:

Backend Development: Designing scalable, secure, and performant systems.
Game Development: Creating immersive gameplay mechanics, crafting unique stories, and designing fun player interactions.
I firmly believe that Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the cornerstone of maintainable and reusable code, and Java is unparalleled in delivering its true potential.
