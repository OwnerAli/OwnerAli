**About Me**

I enjoy creating new content and experiences, whether it‚Äôs through backend systems, immersive gameplay, or solving complex problems. My journey as a developer is driven by a passion for building efficient, dependable solutions that make a real impact.

Most of my backend experience is in Java, where I‚Äôve worked with Spring Boot, REST APIs, and databases like MySQL and MongoDB. I‚Äôm especially passionate about game development, using it as a creative outlet to craft entirely new experiences for players‚Äîunique worlds brought to life through engaging storylines and interactive designs. I mostly use server-side mods for Minecraft, to bring my ideas to thousands of people around the world.

I believe Object-Oriented Programming is the best paradigm for creating structured and scalable software, and Java embodies its principles better than any other language. To me, programming is a perfect balance of logic and creativity, and I aim to bring both into every project I work on.
